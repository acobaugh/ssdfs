SSDFS - Simple Stupid Distributed Filesystem

SSDFS is not a filesystem per se, rather it is (currently) a series of shell
functions that make managing symlink farms in order to give the illusion of a
true distributed filesystem easier.

Some of the filesystem and volume level functions are near direct copies of the
equivalent AFS or DCE/DFS commands.

SSDFS is being written for BX internal usage in order to manage a symlink farm
distrbuted via AFS, pointing to a collection of NFS exports.
